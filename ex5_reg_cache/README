Cached variable has no scope.
It is set as a global variable as default.

### Confusions' cases:

## Case 1: Reg var after cache var

set(a "1" CACHE STRING "")
set(a "2")

message("${a}") shows 2.

A reg variable is set after the cached variable with the same name.
Once a is reused. Its value will be the same as the regular var's, namely, 2.

## Case 2: Cache var after Reg var

set(a "1")
set(a "2" CACHE STRING "")

message("${a}") shows 2 instead of 1.

A cached var is set after a reg one with the same name.
The cached var will automatically unset the reg var.

Run again

message("${a}") shows 1.

An older cached var is set in cache file.
Second set is uesless.

## Case 3: Cache var after Reg var after Cache var

set(a "1" CACHE STRING "")
set(a "2")
set(a "3" CACHE STRING "")

Message("${a}") shows 2

after first set, a is 1
second set shadows first set, a is 2
and since there exists an old cached value, third set is useless.

Run again

Message("${a}") shows 2
